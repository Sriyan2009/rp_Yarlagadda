                        <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft" id="">In this study, several different machine learning models were trained on exoplanet data gathered by NASAâ€™s Kepler Telescope on exoplanet data. The study aimed to find if any models were significantly more accurate, and which are the most accurate. First, the data was downloaded from the source and modified until it was ready for a computer to understand. This includes steps such as dropping unwanted columns and numerizing text data. Each model was trained on the data and then tested. In addition to testing several different types of models, hyperparameters were also used to find the best model possible. The models were then tested and statistics like their average accuracy, loss, and standard deviation were calculated. This was used to determine if the models were statistically significantly accurate using a threshold of 95% accuracy. This study found that the machine learning models performed exceptionally well, with all but three of the models being significantly accurate. In addition, all of the models were significantly accurate when their best hyperparameters were used. Overall, this study concluded that machine learning is a very powerful tool for exoplanet detection, and can be of excellent use in the future. The best types of models and best hyperparameters for each model were also found in this study.</p>

                        <p class="lead overfiew-font ovPadRight" id="">Exoplanets, planets that orbit stars beyond our solar system, are crucial to advancing our understanding of planetary formation and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. While traditional detection methods such as the transit method, radial velocity, and gravitational microlensing have enabled important discoveries, they remain inefficient and often limited to rare or specific conditions. These challenges highlight the need for new approaches that can more accurately and consistently identify exoplanets. Machine learning, with its ability to detect deep patterns in complex and noisy data, offers a promising solution. Previous studies have already demonstrated strong results, with advanced models like convolutional neural networks achieving accuracies above 95%. Simpler approaches have also been effective, showing that even low-complexity models can contribute meaningfully. This study expands on these efforts by evaluating multiple machine learning models to determine which are best suited for reliable exoplanet detection.</p>

                        <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft" id="">The rationale for this study lies in the limitations of current exoplanet detection methods and the growing potential of machine learning. Traditional approaches like transit detection and radial velocity require very specific conditions, often leading to missed discoveries or unreliable results. Telescope data is also frequently corrupted by noise, which reduces accuracy and makes manual analysis time-consuming for astronomers. Machine learning, however, has already proven successful in other scientific fields by extracting meaningful patterns from messy, complex datasets. Applying these techniques to exoplanet detection could make the process faster, more efficient, and more reliable. Improving detection methods is not only important for advancing astronomy but also for addressing long-term questions about planetary formation, resource discovery, and the search for life. For these reasons, testing a range of machine learning models provides valuable insight into which approaches are most effective and how future research in this field can be directed.</p>
